Hey folks! I‚Äôm looking for a¬†PM with 2+ years of Product experience, ideally someone who's worked at startups and knows what building from scratch really looks like. My ideal candidate brings:

1. User research: Not ‚Äúwe sent a survey‚Äù but ‚ÄúI spent 3 days shadowing users and found insights that changed the roadmap‚Äù
2. Data analytics: Defining KPIs, digging for insights, and yes, writing your own queries
3. MVP mindset: Can spin up MVPs with¬†Google Sheets, Notion, Zapier, or duct tape - and has actually shipped them
4. Team management: Lead APMs and align tech, design, ops, and marketing without losing your mind (No, you won‚Äôt make PPTs or manage JIRA. We're too busy building.)

Who is¬†not¬†my PM:
1. You‚Äôve never worked in/with startups
2. You‚Äôve only been a scrum master for tasks handed over by manager/business team
3. You‚Äôre a fresher (we love the young mind energy, but this role needs battle experience)

If this sounds like you or someone you‚Äôd bet on, apply here: https://lnkd.in/gx49aYNK

Note: If your profile is shortlisted, you‚Äôll receive an Ai interview link via email as Round 1 - the interviewer will be an Ai agent.

About Carrum: We‚Äôre a¬†14-month-old startup¬†that‚Äôs already scaled to a¬†‚Çπ250 Cr+ annualised revenue run rate,¬†profitably. We‚Äôre a¬†small team (yes, we hate PPTs too) doing big things with¬†real users, real scale, and real profits.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramdev-saharan-213339151?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACSI5O8B1vP75XHeZ8u63RbRw9X_rpvZayI; https://lnkd.in/gx49aYNK; https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA2h_SoBc7RU-K83em3JrEZn8LAQDnf7iIA; https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA7oppYBlTbmUW6h8JuZiq2GsvMJspOWIWw; https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACysKFgBFvOiYN7r6mwXdQxSJkBX0CPTNzc; https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAArLhEkBAUONBCG1Rdkv9OJ-00Cc6lnPhpA; https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAC8lL9kBA1SCQ04Q8RHuTD44BSorQdNjmL4; https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACk4dHkBS9lVRA9MbVS9rd5i1-LhfCxTyzc; https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAC1n1IwBEdMAwi4cUx-ZrNdEtDo_NahkgM8; https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAADsynioBPTI-rkBLMQVxgqjEJwmuo2Tb8aY; https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishav-bhowmick-43847316b; https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramdev-saharan-213339151; https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishav-bhowmick-43847316b/; https://www.linkedin.com/in/sneha-k-717165229; https://www.linkedin.com/in/sneha-k-717165229/; https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishangupta03; https://www.linkedin.com/company/jobslet/posts; https://jobslet.in/; https://www.linkedin.com/company/adwordtv/posts; https://topmate.io/soulinproduct/1466350; https://www.linkedin.com/company/thefintechpm/posts; https://thefintechpm.my.canva.site/jobs; https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-teja-vakkalanka-95187727b; https://www.linkedin.com/in/jugashrasta-dash-011626b6; https://www.linkedin.com/in/durga-prasad-dash/; https://www.linkedin.com/in/pragnesh-gourav-sahu,,15,"[{""commentor"": ""Rishav Bhowmick"", ""comment"": ""Product Management @Sochio | Ex-StayVista || Ex-Uravu Labs""}, {""commentor"": ""Ramdev Saharan"", ""comment"": ""Rishav Bhowmick thanks Rishav, you‚Äôll receive an Ai interview (panelist will be an Ai agent) link.

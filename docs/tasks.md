- **Legal Compliance**: Must respect LinkedIn's Terms of Service

### Risk Mitigation
- **Fallback Strategies**: Multiple approaches for each critical function
- **Conservative Rate Limits**: Start with very conservative delays
- **Manual Mode Support**: Always provide headed mode for challenges
- **Regular Testing**: Automated tests to catch breaking changes early

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Login Success Rate**: >95% successful logins
- **Data Extraction Success**: >90% posts fully extracted
- **System Uptime**: >99% availability during scheduled runs
- **Error Recovery**: <5% permanent failures after retries

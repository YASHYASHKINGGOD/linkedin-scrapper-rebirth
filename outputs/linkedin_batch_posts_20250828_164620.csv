I’m looking for a PM with 2+ years of Product experience, ideally someone who's worked at startups and knows what building from scratch really looks like. My ideal candidate brings: 1. User research: Not “we sent a survey” but “I spent 3 days shadowing users and found insights that changed the roadmap”2. Data analytics: Defining KPIs, digging for insights, and yes, writing your own queries3. MVP mindset: Can spin up MVPs with Google Sheets, Notion, Zapier, or duct tape - and has actually shipped them4. Team management: Lead APMs and align tech, design, ops, and marketing without losing your mind (No, you won’t make PPTs or manage JIRA. We're too busy building.)Who is not my PM:1. You’ve never worked in/with startups2. You’ve only been a scrum master for tasks handed over by manager/business team3. You’re a fresher (we love the young mind energy, but this role needs battle experience)If this sounds like you or someone you’d bet on, apply here: https://lnkd.in/gx49aYNKNote: If your profile is shortlisted, you’ll receive an Ai interview link via email as Round 1 - the interviewer will be an Ai agent.About Carrum: We’re a 14-month-old startup that’s already scaled to a ₹250 Cr+ annualised revenue run rate, profitably. We’re a small team (yes, we hate PPTs too) doing big things with real users, real scale, and real profits.hashtag#productmanagement hashtag#hiring hashtag#startupjobs hashtag#PMhiring hashtag#techcareers",1d,,,,https://lnkd.in/gx49aYNK; https://topmate.io/soulinproduct/1466350; https://jobslet.in/,,#productmanagement; #hiring; #startupjobs; #PMhiring; #techcareers,,5,"[{""comment_id"": 1, ""commentor_name"": ""Sneha K."", ""commentor_title"": """", ""comment_text"": """", ""comment_date"": ""1d"", ""comment_likes"": """"}, {""comment_id"": 2, ""commentor_name"": ""Sneha K."", ""commentor_title"": """", ""comment_text"": """", ""comment_date"": ""1d"", ""comment_likes"": """"}, {""comment_id"": 3, ""commentor_name"": ""Rishav Bhowmick"", ""commentor_title"": """", ""comment_text"": """", ""comment_date"": ""1d"", ""comment_likes"": """"}, {""comment_id"": 4, ""commentor_name"": ""Rishav Bhowmick"", ""commentor_title"": """", ""comment_text"": """", ""comment_date"": ""1d"", ""comment_likes"": """"}, {""comment_id"": 7, ""commentor_name"": ""Durga Prasad Dash"", ""commentor_title"": """", ""comment_text"": """", ""comment_date"": ""23h"", ""comment_likes"": """"}]",2025-08-28T16:45:49.243605,True,
